# The Alchemist’s Codex

### Mastering Python’s Import Mysteries

A structured Python laboratory designed to explore the four sacred mysteries of code organization: package initialization, import pathways, transmutation styles, and breaking the circular curse.

## Laboratory Structure
The laboratory is organized into a modular package to demonstrate professional Python architecture:

*   `alchemy/` - Main laboratory package.
*   `elements.py` - Basic elemental spell functions.
*   `potions.py` - Advanced potion recipe functions.
*   `transmutation/` - Sub-package for transformation spells.
*   `grimoire/` - Sub-package for spell documentation.

## The Four Sacred Mysteries
This project documents the mastery of:
1.  **The Sacred Scroll (`__init__.py`)**: Transforming folders into magical packages.
2.  **Import Transmutation**: Mastery of `import`, `from...import`, and `as` syntax.
3.  **The Great Pathway Debate**: Implementing Absolute vs. Relative imports.
4.  **The Circular Curse**: Techniques for resolving circular dependencies.

## Installation & Usage
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. No external libraries are required (no dark magic).

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd test_react_ts

python3 -m alchemy.main
```
